#Lloyd's 15 

A 15 tile sliding puzzle  that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.
he object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in row-wise order making sliding moves that use the empty space.

I made this since i felt nostalgic about my childhood days , when this puzzle was popular .
